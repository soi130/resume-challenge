# Cloud Resume Challenge: AWS + DevOps Self Study ‚òÅÔ∏è üöÄ

This repository is my journey through the Cloud Resume Challenge, where I embarked on an exciting adventure to build a modern, cloud-native resume website. Leveraging the power of AWS, GitHub Actions, and Terraform, I gained invaluable experience in deploying scalable infrastructure and implementing robust DevOps practices.

## Overview üîç

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project that challenged me to build a resume website and seamlessly deployed on AWS using various cloud services. The project challenge you to set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for efficient and automated deployments, ensuring a smooth and streamlined development process.

## Features üåü

- **Resume Website**: A simple website about my professional experience, skills, and projects. The website is dynamically connected to the backend infrastructure, updating the latest visitor count.

- **Cloud Hosting**: Utilizing AWS's robust hosting services, including S3, CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager, and Route 53, the website is hosted in a highly available and scalable environment.

- **Backend**: Leveraging DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway, I provisioned a reliable database and API endpoint, enabling the website to seamlessly update and retrieve visitor count data.

- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright, a powerful end-to-end testing framework, was employed to run comprehensive tests on every code commit, ensuring its functionality and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Embracing modern DevOps practices, I implemented a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud, ensuring efficient and automated deployments.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: The entire AWS infrastructure was provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, managed through Terraform Cloud, promoting consistency and version control.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: To ensure optimal performance and troubleshoot any issues, I integrated CloudWatch and AWS Lambda for comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities.
